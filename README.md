## Description

This is a CS 1400 project that I collaborated with fellow students to develop. This project represents an arbitrary simulation of how a disease would spread within a two-dimensional grid, with given user input. The user can view how various infection and recovery rates of diseases can affect their overall spread within a population each timestep.

1. Run Simulation.java
2. Enter a number of individuals that is a perfect square. EX: 25
3. Enter the number of time steps the model will be run. EX: 10
4. Enter a number from 0 - 0.25 that will be the infection rate of an individual. EX: 0.2
5. Enter a number from 0 - 1 that will be the recovery rate of an individual. EX: 0.3
6. View in the console log how the disease spread each timestep and how individuals recovered.
